    <h1>Crisp Peach Cobbler</h1>
    <img src="../images/crisp-peach-cobbler/peach-cobbler.webp">

    <p>
        This recipe was inspired by one from Renee Erickson's in cookbook, 'A Boat, a Whale, and a Walrus.' 
        It's a lot crispier than a regular cobbler, and you can use the technique for other fruit cobblers. 
        Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large fresh peaches, pitted and cut into eighths</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <h4>Batter:</h4>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>⅔ cup whole milk</li>
        <h4>Glaze:</h4>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water, or as needed to wet topping sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <h4>Step 1:</h4>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            Place a baking sheet on the rack under the middle rack to catch drips. 
            Generously butter a 2-inch deep (2-quart) baking dish.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 2:</h4>
        <li>
            Place peach sections into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice and zest.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 3:</h4>
        <li>
            Stir butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl.
            Mix until creamed and resembles a sugary, buttery paste, 4 to 5 minutes. 
            Add oats and flour; stir until flour and oats are incorporated into the butter-sugar mixture and mixture resembles coarse crumbs, 4 to 5 minutes. 
            Pour in milk; stir until mixture is wet and creamy, like a thick spreadable batter, 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 4:</h4>
        <li>
            Drop batter by spoonful on top of the peaches.
            Spread batter evenly over the surface of the peaches.Sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar on the batter. 
            Spritz with water until sugar is wet and surface glistens.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 5:</h4>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven on middle rack until browned and crispy, 
            about 45 minutes. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving.
        </li>
       
    </ul>

    <h3>Baker's Note</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To make your own self-rising flour, 
            whisk 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 
            and 1/2 teaspoon fine salt together in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you don't have a water spritzer, 
            you can use a pastry brush to moisten the sugar topping.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use ripe and juicy peaches for the best flavor. Look for peaches that are fragrant, 
            slightly soft to the touch, and have vibrant colors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Peel the peaches and slice them into even pieces. 
            Removing the skin ensures a smooth texture in the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enhance the peach flavor with a touch of spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg. 
            these warm spices complement the peaches beautifully.
        </li>
