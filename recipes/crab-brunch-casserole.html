    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use high-quality, fresh crab meat for the best flavor and texture. 
            If possible, opt for lump crab meat, as it offers larger, succulent pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enhance the flavors by using a balanced mix of spices and herbs.
            Consider incorporating a dash of Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder, 
            and a pinch of cayenne pepper for a zesty kick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Consider garnishing the finished casserole with fresh chopped parsley or green onions for a pop of color and a burst of freshness.
