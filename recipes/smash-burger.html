        Discover the secrets to crafting incredibly juicy smash burgers with perfectly crispy edges. 
        For optimal results, avoid using meat leaner than an 80/20 ratio, 
        and ensure it's kept extremely cold. To minimize any kitchen smoke,
        I recommend cooking them outdoors. 
        Due to the high heat, these burgers cook up quickly, 
        so be prepared and have everything ready to go beforehand!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese or preferred </li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <h4>Step 1:</h4>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 2:</h4>
        <li>
            Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 3:</h4>
        <li>
            Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each.
            Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. 
            Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment
            (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty)
            nd immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff,
            sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down.
            You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 4:</h4>
        <li>
            Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color.
            Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese.
            Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. 
            Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        If you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish towel for protection,
        and use it to press down on the spatula with both hands.
        </li>

        <li>
        You can make 4 (4 ounce) patties instead of 8 (2 ounce patties), 
        but I prefer the thinner patties that have more crispy surface area.
        </li>

        <li>
            I buy American cheese freshly-sliced from the deli, 
            but individually-wrapped slices will work too.
