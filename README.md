# odin-recipes
The first project within the odin project curriculum. This is a simple recipe website to show my current HTML skill as of 7/24/23. By the end of the project I should have a website that looks very simple but has the functionality to show multiple different recipes and contain hyperlinks to move to the other recipes.
